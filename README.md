# Thundr App

This app is designed for a brainstorm collaboration remotely or in one room.
It supports a common webscreen (facilitator's console) and multiple connected mobile apps (clients) for people participating in the brainstorm.
Teammates submit suggestions via voice or typing and facilitator arranges ideas onscreen, edits them or changes collaboration channels (topics).
Facilitator can also force all teammates to vote on suggested topics.

### Usage: Open the app in the web browser http://thundrweb.herokuapp.com/ (may take a while to load)
